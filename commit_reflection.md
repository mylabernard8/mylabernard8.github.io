### Reflection
* Yes, I can clearly track my websites developments through the titles I have made my commits. I can see the different stages I was at through this building process and can follow its growth process.
* I feel that my commit messages are effective at conveying what I was doing for the most part, apart from the three titles of: bold, bold, changed back. These titles are not very clear to what I was doing because even though I was experimenting with the different features of markdown and seeing what worked best, I didn't show that in my titles.
* Being able to clearly label and mark what changes I made to a file can help in many other places of my life as organization is very important. For example, in the academic stand point, labeling all my own notes and documents clearly will help me in the future if I need to study for something that I wrote down in those particular places.
